    <h2>Society for Neuroscience Annual Conference</h2>

<h3>Sunday</h3>

<p>The annual Society for Neuroscience conference is here! It got kicked off yesterday but Sunday was my first day as Saturday was my traveling day. I flew out of SLC in the afternoon at 3:00 PM and arrived in San Diego an hour later local time. I took a taxi to my hotel (which amounted to highway robbery), checked in and got settled. It was already fairly late in the day at that point so I went for a run. Turns out Sunny San Diego has a bit of a dark side. I was running near the University of California at San Diego Medical Center. Found multiple piles of garbage strewn about the street, feces, and evidence of multiple encampments. Apparently California really does have a homelessness problem. After that I went back to the hotel and did not leave for the rest of the night. I was far enough from downtown that walking would have been a long affair and taking a taxi would have been costly. So I called it a day.
</p>

<p>The dynamic interaction of vision and eye movements was the first minisymposium I attended and it was a bit out in left field. The methods most of the investigators used were focused around electrophysiological recordings in various animal models. Not exactly what I generally investigate. After that I caught the tail end of a talk on Multiscale Modeling of Brain Disease by W.W Lytton, from State University of New York State. He focused on using computer based models to understand and simulate neurological function at the level of the cell, circuit, and brain. I wonder if this could be used in the classroom (maybe for an advanced neuroscience class) to teach principles of neuronal circuitry. It would certainly be a better alternative to just discussing the concepts in class and using theoretical questioning to probe understanding. I think it could be interesting.
</p>

<p>After that I attended a presidential lecture on Neural Data Science: Accelerating the Experiment-Analysis-Theory Cycle in Large-Scale Neuroscience, by Liam Paninski. That was interesting. His talk centered around the open neuroscience movement, and one of his projects in particular which is focused on finding new ways to make optigenetic and microscopy available to the broader scientific community through appropriate data filtration and compression. He also made a broader plea for more students to seek training in data science (which I agree with). Neuroscience is on the edge of a new era in terms of reproducibility and data analysis. Thanks to the internet and increased local computing power and the availability of remote computing we can now conduct studies that were impossible before. However this data will go to waste if there is not anyone to look at it.</p>

<h4>Scribbles from other meetings</h4>

<p>Neural data science – We need more neural data scientists, people who can speak the language of neuroscience and statistics.
</p>

<p>Notes</p>
<ol>
	<li>Is he using LaTex?</li>
	<li>An Internation Laboratory for Systems and Computational Neuroscience, Neuron</li>
	<li>Bottle necks: How to reconcile large datasets from disparate modalities?</li>
	<li>Ways to do so - filtering out noise, making dataset a little coarser so it requires less memory (though I do not think this is completely necessary as memory capacity and computing power are increasing at an exponential rate).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Monday</h3>

<p>Nanosymposium on vision and eye movements was electrifying, and by that was comprised primarily of electrophysiological studies of the superior colliculus. While not my primary interest, I attended because it was somewhat related to my field of research. Unfortunately the talk that drew my initial attention ended up being a no show (which is something that I would think would never happen at an international conference). In lieu of that speaker the chairman just had us take a short break.</p>

<h4>David Kopf lecture on Neuroethics: When is an adolescent an adult? Implications for Justice Policy by B. J. Casey</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Healthy development is a fundamental right. Declaration of the rights of the child, League of Nations and UN. (Not sure this is a right but certainly a noble aim)</li>
	<li>Relevant Court Cases</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Roper v. Simmons (2005): No death penalty for minors.</li>
		<li>Graham v. Florida (2010)</li>
		<li>Miller v. Alabama (2012)</li>
		<li>Montgomery v. Louisiana (2016)</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Cohen, 2016, Temple Law review</li>
	<li>Key questions</li>
	<ul>
		<li>When do cognitive, emotional, social abilities reach maturity?</li>
		<li>What are the signs?</li>
		<li>Does the law align with these markers?</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Whack a mole, asymptote at 16-17, Durston 2002, Casey & Caudle, 2013</li>
	<li>Cognitive ability reaches maturity apparently around 16-17 years old.</li>
	<li>Sommerville et al 2011 JoCN, Smiling cues, teens are more impulsive to positive social cues.</li>
	<li>Adolescents are more reactive to negative cues. Influence of negative social cues, Dreyfuss, 2014 Developmental Neuroscience</li>
	<li>Most crime committed in groups, National Crime victimization survey, 2014</li>
	<li>Adolescents with a peer perform worse, crash paradigm, Chein, 2010</li>
	<li>Steinburg, Cauffman, 2009, American Psychologist, Cognitive, Psychosocial maturity</li>
	<li>So cognitive abilities mature at about 16-17 while other social and emotional abilities finish sometime in the late teens and early twenties.</li>
	<li>Somerville, 2016, Neuron, Signatures of Brain Maturity.</li>
	<li>However, young children do not show the same degree of difference from adults that teens do so this may be due to a developmentally driven imbalance of systems rather than a lag in development.</li>
	<li>Functional conectome becomes more distinct with age, Kauffman 2017, Nat Neuro</li>
	<li>Young Adult courts</li>
</ul>

<h4>Intersubject correlation for social and non-social videos in the default mode network, Mark Straccia, UCLA</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Potential DMN causes</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Is the DMN involved in the language, narrative, social tasks for video?</li>
		<li>duth 2016</li>
		<li>husson 2017 TICS - narratives</li>
		<li>Story comprehension - lerner 2015, J neuro</li>
		<li>Ames 2015 J cog neuro</li>
		<li></li>
	</ul>
	<li>Did you account for eye movements or engagement?</li>
	<li>Apparently saw greatest activation for non-language social interactions.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Thinking ahead: Using ECoG to map the spatiotemporal dynamics of prediction during natural language comprehension, Amy Price, Uri Hasson, Princeton</h4>
<ul>
	<li>ECoG - electrocorticography (electrodes in epilepsy patients)</li>
	<li>Computed cloze probability for words</li>
	<li>Sorted words into groups (high v. low) using linguistic factors</li>
	<li>High predictability - Higher cortical regions were recruited up to 200 msec faster, indicating anticipatory processing was occuring.</li>
</ul>
