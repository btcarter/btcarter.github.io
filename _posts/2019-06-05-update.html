<h2>What happened?</h2>

<p>I have reorganized the site so tutorials do not post directly to the main page but now are added as a separate collection of documents. You will find them under the Tutorials tab in the top right-hand side of the page.</p>

<p>I have also altered the site domain. It was once listed under bc-brains.com but is now renamed something more generic, benjamintcarter.org. This was a long overdue update as I realized I need a site that was a bit more generic in its naming convention so it was more appropriately connected the site mission. The name bc-brains was starting to appear both clich√© and limiting. I'm going to start looking for post-doctoral positions in the near future and will probably use this site to post material related to my work, classes I teach, and other random things related to my interests.</p>

<p>There are some additional updates in the future. I may reorganize the tutorials again and break it off into a subdomain once it gets sufficiently large. Class information will also be added as its own subdomain as well once that material is posted (this is probably imminent).
