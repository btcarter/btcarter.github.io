I should have known that something was up that morning when Dr. Luke sent me a text message asking if I was in the lab. Usually its the otherway around. That's when he told me about a postdoctoral opportunity in Davis, California. The only catch? I was going to complete my dissertation in six months instead of eighteen. Talk about stress and anticipation! We're currently trying to arrange for an interview some time later this summer so I can learn more about it and make a better decision about going there.

In the meantime my wife and I have been online trying to do some digital scouting. From what we can tell, the cost of living is incredibly high, as much as 15-20% higher. Most of that is due to the cost of rent (or a mortgage, though we can't afford a mortgage). Our current residence would cost about $2,500 a month, a 100% increase, if it were located in Davis. How am I supposed to support a family on $50,000? We'll figure that out I suppose.
