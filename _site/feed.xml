In psychology and neuroscience this is used to study how we respond to stimuli, which could be anything from a picture of a scene, a video, or even text. It has been used as an ad-hoc measure of sympathetic activation. It’s use in business has primarily been focused on customer behavior, such as when viewing an advertisement.

<p>It is important for scientists and analysts in the private and public sectors to have adequate training and instruction on eye tracking theory and practice.

The first was the addiction lab at BYU, which utilized rodent models to investigate involvement of reward centers in the brain in addiction. The second was the cardiothoracic research lab at the University of Virginia, which used the porcine model to investigate new methods for lung transplantation. The third (and current lab) is the BYU eye-tracking lab, headed by Dr. Steven Luke. This lab was quite different from the others. Instead of utilizing animals, our research requires humans to willingly participate in our research. Successful experimentation no longer requires good surgical techniques, nor can comfort be administered in the form of an opiod or paralytic. It requires soft skills in order to interact with a participant in order to build repoire and help them feel comfortable. This adds a social aspect to my science that was absent from my previous research.
</p>

<p>In my short time as a graduate student, I have observed these skills to be somewhat lacking among researchers, particularly those just getting started. This is not surprising as much of this can only be mastered through practiced experience. A good mentor who can train, observe and critique is especially helpful. I just got thrown right into middle of things while a graduate student. Luckily for me, my service as a proselyting missionary (imagine going door to door trying to talk to people about religion all day) and my rudimentary training in medical interviews prior to graduate school has made working with people a less than foreign concept. This has made the transition from animals to humans less awkward, though I still make a great deal of mistakes.
</p>

<p>What I present here are some thoughts (in no particular order) on how to become a better human researcher, especially for those who have not recieved any training in human research methods (e.g. any non-clinical neuroscience or physiology program).</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>Find an expert:</em> Having an expert to observe and train under is incredibly useful. If you are in a lab with leaders who are hands-off or uninvolved then do not be afraid to ask to watch them do it first. Ask them to allow you to practice on them once or twice just so you can get a feel for things. Ask for feedback often.</li>
  <li><em>Know your protocol/tests:</em> I won't say memorize your protocol (it might be long enough to be impractical) but certainly know it well enough to make executing it second nature. You should refer to your notes to double check yourself, not to tell you what to do next. This allows you to proceed through a participant interview or testing fluidly and comfortably. If you are comfortable the participant will be comfortable (or at least less uncomfortable)!</li>
  <li><em>Be prepared:</em> Take time prior to the participant interview to prepare the room and set out all the materials you will need, whether that's a lab manual, test forms, stimuli, or digital protocol. This will help you by giving you visual cues to remind you what to do and what order (making for a fluid interaction), as well as present yourself as a professional to your participant. This builds repoire.</li>
  <li><em>Be professional:</em> Manners maketh man. Present yourself as a professional. Do not show up in sweat pants and a t-shirt. Wear clothes that set a professional tone. Consider the participant's cultural predisposition as well. Try to make them comfortable. Your explicit t-shirt may be funny, but it may give your participant a reason not to trust you or think the research is a big joke like you.</li>
  <li><em>Be water:</em> One of Bruce Lee's maxims, it certainly applies to human research. While you should stick to the script of your protocol, the only thing that is certain in research is that no single trial or experiment perfectly conforms to the protocol. Sometimes it is because of the participant, e.g. they show up late to an appointment, or there is some unforseen medical complication. At times it is expedient for you to leave the scripted protocal behind and ask questions not in the script as a means of clarifying some point. Do not let this fluster you. When something unscripted happens just roll with it and document it. No matter who wrote the protocol, there is no way it will address every single contingency. No man or woman is all knowing enough to create such a document. Protocols delineate default action, but they should not limit you as a researcher, so long as you document what happens and what you did.</li>

I was going to complete my dissertation in six months instead of eighteen. Talk about stress and anticipation! We're currently trying to arrange for an interview some time later this summer so I can learn more about it and make a better decision about going there.

In the meantime my wife and I have been online trying to do some digital scouting. From what we can tell, the cost of living is incredibly high, as much as 15-20% higher. Most of that is due to the cost of rent (or a mortgage, though we can't afford a mortgage). Our current residence would cost about $2,500 a month, a 100% increase, if it were located in Davis. How am I supposed to support a family on $50,000? We'll figure that out I suppose.]]></content><author><name>Benjamin Carter</name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I should have known that something was up that morning when Dr. Luke sent me a text message asking if I was in the lab.

<p>I have reorganized the site so tutorials do not post directly to the main page but now are added as a separate collection of documents. You will find them under the Tutorials tab in the top right-hand side of the page.</p>

<p>I have also altered the site domain. It was once listed under bc-brains.com but is now renamed something more generic, benjamintcarter.org. This was a long overdue update as I realized I need a site that was a bit more generic in its naming convention so it was more appropriately connected the site mission. The name bc-brains was starting to appear both cliché and limiting. I'm going to start looking for post-doctoral positions in the near future and will probably use this site to post material related to my work, classes I teach, and other random things related to my interests.</p>

<p>There are some additional updates in the future. I may reorganize the tutorials again and break it off into a subdomain once it gets sufficiently large. Class information will also be added as its own subdomain as well once that material is posted (this is probably imminent).

<p>Neuroimaging projects produce a lot of data. For example, one of my recent projects produced an average of 3 GB of data per participant after the analysis was completed (and there were over 40 participants, which means there was about 120 GB of data). And that was for one functional analysis. Once I complete the structural, DTI, and resting state analyses I expect the data will grow exponentially, and this is for just one study. Imaging how much data I will be dealing with after a decade of research.
</p>
<p>
Keeping this data organized is time consuming, a little complicated, and is not standardized between labs, until recently. Gorgolewski, et al. (2016) has proposed a standardized method for researchers to implement called the <i>brain imaging data structure</i> (BIDS). It looks something like this.
</p>

<figure>
	<img src="https://media.nature.com/lw926/nature-assets/sdata/2016/sdata201644/images_hires/sdata201644-f1.jpg" alt="Figure 1, example of BIDS from Gorgolewski, et al 2016.">
	<figcaption>Figure 1 from Gorgolewski, et al 2016. An example of a BIDS formatted dataset</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I'll save myself summarizing the paper. It's fairly simple so if you want to learn more about it just checkout the link listed below. The above figure does a decent job of capturing the idea. Essentially, DICOMs (and other forms of raw data) are kept in a separate directory from your processed data. Derived data (i.e. the data you produce during preprocessing and analysis like BRIK and HEAD files in AFNI) is then organized within a study directory by subject, then within a directory for that data type.
</p>

<p>Another layer of organization can be found in file naming syntax. Files are named such that if they are moved from their home directory they can still be identified. The naming convention is as follows: <code>participantID_imagingSequence</code>. Additional files are included for metadata such as participant lists, and lists of data types with descriptions. These are usually formated as tab-delimited files.
</p>

<p>For more information I really do suggest reading the original article (see below). It should only take about 20 minutes!
