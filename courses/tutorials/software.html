<meta name="description" content="Keeping track of and staying up to date with computer software is a scourge of modern life. Setting up a computer for personal use can be a hassel, especially when that time could be spent doing something else. I speak from experience. I once killed three laptops in a single semester as an undergraduate. The time spent reconfiguring each one was frustrating and I eventually began using Google Drive exclusively to avoid having to setup another computer again. This was a reasonable solution until I moved beyond basic WYSIWYG type documents and presentations and I began having to rely on local computing again, which meant I had returned to the realm of DIY tech support. It became apparent that an index of the software would greatly facilitate resuscitating or setting up a computer in the future. So I have created (and will update) this list of all the software/services I have used for scientific computing. It will become longer and more comprehensive with time." />
